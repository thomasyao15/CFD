# Example Prompts for Testing CFD

These example prompts demonstrate how to target each of the three teams (Ops Change, IO Change, Hyperautomation) and provide all required field information.

## Ops Change Team Example

I need help automating our monthly performance attribution reporting. Currently, our team manually consolidates data from Pearl into Excel spreadsheets every month, which takes about 2 days and is prone to errors. We want to build a PowerBI dashboard that pulls this data automatically and calculates time-weighted returns and benchmarks. This is necessary to have - it's causing reconciliation issues and our stakeholders need accurate performance data faster. We need funding approval and access to the Pearl API. This aligns with Market leading net performance since it improves our investment reporting accuracy, and Value at a competitive cost because it eliminates manual work. The benefits are reducing reporting time by 80% and eliminating calculation errors. Jane Smith from Investment Operations is sponsoring this. This addresses Risk to Multiple Teams because both the performance and risk reporting teams rely on this data. We also want to add accruals tracking in the same dashboard.

## IO Change Team Example

We need to integrate our Aladdin portfolio management system with the WSO Notice Manager platform. Our private credit team currently manually transfers unlisted asset data between these systems, which creates delays and reconciliation headaches. This integration should sync data automatically and provide a unified dashboard for our global locations. This is important to have for operational efficiency. Dependencies include technology readiness and completion of the Aladdin upgrade project. This supports Personalised guidance at scale and Value at a competitive cost by improving our alternative assets management. The benefit is real-time visibility into our private credit portfolio and eliminating 10 hours of manual data entry per week. John Doe, Head of Alternative Assets, is sponsoring this. It's a Risk to a Single Team - just the private credit operations team. We have budget allocated and the Calypso team has expressed interest in a similar integration.

## Hyperautomation Team Example

I want to build a Power App that streamlines our employee onboarding process. Right now, HR manually creates accounts, sends welcome emails, assigns equipment, and schedules training sessions using multiple disconnected tools. I envision a single Power App where a manager clicks a button, enters new hire details, and Power Automate workflows handle everything automatically - creating accounts in our systems, triggering equipment requests, sending personalized welcome emails, and scheduling onboarding sessions. This is nice to have but would significantly improve employee experience. We need resource availability and executive sign-off from the HR leadership team. This aligns with Talent & Culture and Value at a competitive cost. Benefits include reducing onboarding time from 3 days to 2 hours, eliminating manual errors, and creating a better first-day experience for new employees. I'm sponsoring this myself as the HR Operations Lead. This is Risk to a Single Team - just affecting HR operations. We'd also want to integrate with our existing recruitment tracking system down the line.
