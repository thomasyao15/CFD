We are creating an MVP application, so keep everything as simple and as maintainable as possible. Only write elegant code, do not overcomplicate things, do not overengineer, do not do more than I say. Always double check and ask me if this is simple enough.

Modularise files, keep files clean and minimal. Follow CLEAN CODE principles AT ALL TIMES.

Always write JSDoc for complex/public functions
